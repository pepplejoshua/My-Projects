This is a C++ implementation for recursively solving a Sudoku grid. The header and implementation files (sudokuGrid.*), and the Makefile are provided by my professor.
The task was to implement the solve function in sudoku.cc that stitched all solving operations together. This was definitely my first satisfying Programming problem to solve.

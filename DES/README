This is a Python implementation of the Data Encryption Algorithm. It requires a minimum of Python 3.4.5 to run. I am really 
happy to be able to complete this project in Python because this is my first major project implementation using the langauge 
and it was great. Greatly reduced amounts of code = More productivity. ❤️ Python
